                <li>1/2 cup cream, full fat</li>
                <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>

                <li>Optional: Berries</li>

            </ul>
    
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For reliable results, work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get too warm!</li>
                <li>Separate eggs and yolks while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Yolks: Whisk yolks until uniform.</li>
                <li>Melt chocolate and butter: Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl with the butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly while you proceed with other steps.</li>
                <li>Whip cream: Beat cream until stiff peaks form, being careful not to over-whip</li>
                <li>Whip whites: Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form</li>
                <li>Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula - 8 folds max. Some streaks is fine.</li>
                <li>Check chocolate temperature: The chocolate should still be runny but warm <em>(min 35C / 95F; ideal 40C / 104F)</em>. If too cool or thick, microwave in burst of 5 seconds at a time until runny.</li>
                <li>Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through - 8 folds max. Some streaks here are ok.</li>
                <li>Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated - "smear" the spatular across surface to blend white lumps in - aim for 10 folds.</li>
                <li>Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white lumps remain - aim for 12 folds max, but ensure there are no obvious egg white patches.</li>
                <li>Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>To serve, garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for color would also be lovely!</li>
            </ol>
